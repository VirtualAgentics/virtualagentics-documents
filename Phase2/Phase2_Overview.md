# Phase 2 Overview: Agentic AI Platform & Core Automation

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the objectives, scope, and technical foundation for **Phase 2** of the Virtual Agentics project. Phase 2 builds directly on the AWS landing zone, agent orchestration, and CI/CD foundations of Phase 1 to deliver a production-ready, persistent multi-agent platform capable of advanced workflows and self-improvement.

---

## 2. Phase 2 Objectives

- Deploy and validate **persistent agent data storage** (DynamoDB, vector DB for embeddings, S3 content/knowledge repositories)
- Implement the **core agentic platform** for orchestrated, event-driven multi-agent workflows
- Enable **retrieval-augmented generation** (RAG): LLM-powered agents with knowledge graph/vector search
- Build **initial SaaS/ML platform components** (e.g., internal agent APIs, public endpoints, core research/analytics workflows)
- Begin **integration of open-source LLMs/AI models** for cost reduction, autonomy, and customizability
- Expand **CI/CD pipelines** for code, model, and infra deployments with branching and environment controls
- Formalize **cost monitoring, budget automation, and observability** for all new workloads

## 3. Major Deliverables & Artifacts

| Area               | Artifact/Module                                              | Status          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Persistent Storage | DynamoDB extensions, vector DB (e.g., Pinecone, Qdrant), S3 | Planned         |
| Agentic Platform   | Multi-agent orchestration layer (CrewAI, LangGraph, etc.)   | Planned         |
| Knowledge/RAG      | Embedding pipelines, vector store, agent RAG interface      | Planned         |
| SaaS/ML Platform   | Initial API endpoints, deployment scripts                   | Planned         |
| Open-Source LLMs   | Self-hosted model (Llama2/Mistral/etc.), inference workflow | Planned         |
| CI/CD Enhancements | Environment-specific pipelines, model registry integration  | Planned         |
| Cost & Observability | CloudWatch/Prometheus dashboards, cost policies           | Planned         |

## 4. Architecture Highlights

- **Persistent Agent Data:** All agents store/retrieve state, embeddings, and artifacts in DynamoDB, S3, and vector DB (deployed as managed service or container)
- **Event-Driven Orchestration:** Message/event contracts from Phase 1 extended to new agents, with CrewAI or LangGraph managing task allocation and history
- **RAG:** Agents retrieve context from vector DB/knowledge graph before LLM invocation
- **SaaS Endpoints:** Internal and (optionally) public APIs exposed via API Gateway, backed by agentic workflows
- **Model Hosting:** Migration of select agent workloads from OpenAI API to self-hosted models, using AWS GPU or managed inference endpoints

---

## 5. Transition and Dependencies

- **Depends on:** Phase 1 completion (landing zone, CI/CD, core Lambda/infra in place)
- **Prepares for:** Phase 3, including agentic departments for Finance, R&D, and Revenue/Trading

---

## 6. Risk and Mitigation

- **Model integration complexity:** Pilot with a single agent or simple SaaS before scaling
- **Data migration:** Ensure idempotency, rollback, and backup/restore before moving to persistent DBs
- **Cost creep:** Tag all resources, set budget alarms, and validate with each environment/agent
- **Security:** Extend least-privilege IAM and audit to new data stores, APIs, and model endpoints

---

## 7. Documentation and Change Control

- Key files:  
    - Phase2_Overview.md (this doc)  
    - [Additional Phase 2 docs to be added as detailed designs progress]
