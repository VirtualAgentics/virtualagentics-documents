# Agent Structure and Role Definitions: Virtual Agentics

## Purpose

This document details the hierarchical structure of Virtual Agentics’ agentic organization, mapping each agent role to corporate-like departments, responsibilities, and inter-agent relationships. It ensures agent boundaries, ownership, and escalation are explicit for auditability and system evolution.

---

## 1. Agent Hierarchy and Departmentalization

- **CEO Agent (Chief Executive Officer)**
  - Sets global objectives (e.g., revenue targets, risk thresholds, system expansion goals)
  - Supervises all C-level agents and reviews/approves department strategies or escalated decisions
  - Handles exceptional decisions and conflict resolution

- **C-level Agents**
  - **CAgO Agent (Chief Agent Officer)**
    - Manages the digital workforce (agent onboarding, offboarding, health, training, permissions)
    - Approves or escalates agent lifecycle changes
    - Reports directly to CEO Agent
  - **CTO Agent (Chief Technology Officer)**
    - Oversees infrastructure, CI/CD, networking, and application security
    - Governs code standards, deployment automation, and DevOps pipelines
    - Owns infrastructure compliance, DR, and cloud cost management
  - **CFO Agent (Chief Financial Officer)**
    - Controls budgets, billing, trading strategies, expense monitoring
    - Authorizes or blocks new expenditures and cloud spend increases
    - Initiates reporting and cost optimizations
  - **CMO Agent (Chief Marketing Officer)**
    - Leads growth, traffic acquisition, SEO, and content strategy
    - Monitors analytics, conversions, and external comms
    - Plans outbound campaigns and reports results to CEO Agent
  - **Compliance/Audit Agent**
    - Monitors regulatory compliance, GDPR, auditing
    - Flags or remediates risky agent/system behavior

---

## 2. Department Agents & Specialist Roles

- **HR Agent(s)**
  - Onboards new agents (creates, assigns roles/permissions, runs background/health checks)
  - Maintains agent directory and access policies
  - Escalates policy issues to CAgO Agent

- **Finance/Trading Agent(s)**
  - Executes automated trades (where allowed), manages cash flow and cloud spend
  - Provides real-time and monthly financial reports to CFO Agent
  - Flags anomalies (unexpected charges, cost spikes)

- **R&D Agent(s)**
  - Conducts autonomous research (e.g., technology, market, ML techniques)
  - Proposes and prototypes new agent roles or system improvements
  - Reports research findings to CTO Agent and CEO Agent

- **Marketing/Content Agent(s)**
  - Generates content (articles, posts, documentation) using LLMs and templates
  - Implements SEO, tracks rankings, and suggests content improvements
  - Coordinates launches/campaigns with CMO Agent

- **Ops Agent(s)**
  - Maintains operational status (CI/CD, DR drills, backups, log review)
  - Handles tickets/incidents, triggers failovers, and escalates major incidents to CTO Agent

- **Compliance Agent(s)**
  - Continuously checks system for security/regulatory breaches
  - Maintains audit logs, runs regular policy scans
  - Enforces credential rotation, encryption, access least-privilege

---

## 3. Agent Naming and Identification

- All agents must have a unique, structured name: `va-agent-<function>-<env>`
  - Example: `va-agent-contentgen-prod`
- Department/Chief agents: `va-agent-<department>-chief-<env>`
  - Example: `va-agent-finance-chief-prod`
- Roles must be reflected in both code (handler, logs) and AWS IAM roles/tags.

---

## 4. Agent Interactions and Escalation Paths

- **CEO Agent** ⇄ **All Chief Agents**
- **Chief Agents** ⇄ **Their Department Agents**
- **Cross-department communication** is allowed only as documented event contracts
- **Project/Task Groups:** Temporary cross-department teams can be created for specific projects, always led by a Project Manager Agent, with clear reporting to relevant Chief(s) and CEO Agent

## 6. Principles

- **Clear accountability:** Every action, escalation, or automated change is mapped to an agent identity.
- **Separation of duties:** No single agent can self-approve cross-domain actions; C-level or CEO Agent must approve.
- **Auditability:** All agent actions and decisions are logged and traceable by design.
- **Extensibility:** New departments or roles can be created using this structure as a template.
