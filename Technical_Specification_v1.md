# Technical Specification: Virtual Agentics Autonomous Company (v1.0)

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines the technical objectives, system requirements, and phased architectural approach for the Virtual Agentics project: an autonomous, AI-driven virtual enterprise built on cloud-native, agentic principles. The goal is to provide a reproducible blueprint for a modular, auditable, and revenue-generating AI business, with strict attention to automation, security, governance, and cost control.

## 2. Project Goals and Objectives

- **Create an autonomous multi-agent “virtual company”** capable of operating, adapting, and generating profit with minimal human oversight.
- **Implement all infrastructure and application code as IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code),** versioned and managed through CI/CD pipelines.
- **Emulate real-world corporate structure** with a CEO agent, C-level domain agents (e.g. CTO, CFO, CMO, CAgO), and department-specialized agents, all coordinated via event-driven protocols.
- **Adopt a phased, modular roadmap** allowing stepwise, auditable growth—prioritizing core foundation and iterative capability addition.
- **Enforce security, compliance, and auditability** as first principles, using strict naming conventions, role separation, and continuous monitoring.
- **Demonstrate financial sustainability:** Cloud spend initially capped at €1,000/month, with detailed scaling criteria and profit-based onboarding scenarios outlined explicitly in [Cost Management and Optimization documentation](Cost_Management_and_Optimization.md).
- **Make the system open, extensible, and self-improving,** providing a reference model for others to replicate or extend.

## 3. Architectural Overview

### 3.1 High-Level System Design

- The system is a **hierarchical, event-driven, multi-agent architecture** running on AWS (with hybrid/on-prem as needed), using Terraform and GitHub Actions for full automation.
- Key architectural pillars:
  - **Landing Zone and AWS Organization:** Control Tower-provisioned, with Management, Audit, Log Archive, and workload accounts segmented by OU and environment (prod, dev, sandbox, shared services).
  - **Network Segmentation:** VPCs and subnets provisioned per the AWS Addressing Plan, using explicit CIDR blocks and subnet tiering (public/private/isolated).
  - **Agentic Layer:** AI agents implemented as serverless microservices (AWS Lambda) and later, containerized workloads (EKS, Fargate) for more persistent roles.
  - **State & Storage:** DynamoDB (single-table design), S3 buckets for content and artifacts, centralized Terraform state in S3 with DynamoDB locking.
  - **Event & Communication Bus:** Agents communicate asynchronously using event buses (SNS/SQS, EventBridge) and direct invocation as required. Events and message schema defined for all inter-agent protocols.
  - **Secrets & Credential Management:** AWS Secrets Manager is used for API keys and sensitive config, with rotation strategies defined.
  - **Observability & Compliance:** CloudWatch for logs/metrics, CloudTrail for audit, Config for compliance checks, Cost Explorer/Budgets for spend management.
  - **CI/CD Pipelines:** All changes (infra/app) deployed via GitHub Actions with OIDC-based role assumption; no static keys.


### 3.4 Multi-Cloud Strategy

A multi-cloud architecture involving providers such as Hetzner, Azure, and GCP will be evaluated explicitly at the conclusion of Phase 2. This evaluation will rely on metrics collected regarding system performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness to determine the necessity and benefits of moving workloads beyond AWS.


### 3.2 Hierarchical Multi-Agent Model

- **CEO Agent:** Sets high-level goals (e.g., “achieve €2K/month profit in 12 months”), approves strategic changes, reviews department outputs.
- **C-Level Domain Agents:** CAgO (Chief Agent Officer, workforce), CTO (infrastructure/DevOps), CFO (finance/trading), CMO/Data (marketing/analytics), others as project evolves.
- **Department Agents:** Specialized for HR (AI agent onboarding), R&D, Finance/Trading, Marketing, Compliance, and so on—each mapped to company-like workflows.
- **Agent Protocols:** All agent tasks, escalations, and collaboration flows are defined via documented event contracts and state transitions.
- **Memory & Learning:** Knowledge graph, vector DBs, and log-driven “organizational memory” are used for retrieval-augmented generation and long-term context.

### 3.3 Phased Roadmap and Milestones

| Phase  | Major Milestones                                                                                      |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Landing zone, network, account structure, naming, baseline IAM, remote Terraform backend, CI/CD, MVP agent(s) |
| 2      | Persistent data stores, advanced AI agent workflows, open-source model integration, SaaS/ML platform  |
| 3      | Departmental agent expansion (Finance, R&D, etc.), trading/revenue agents, learning and optimization  |
| 4      | Enterprise-scale, multi-cloud, high-availability, AI-driven self-improvement, regulatory readiness    |

## 4. Detailed Requirements by Subsystem

### 4.1 AWS Landing Zone & Organization

- **Tool:** AWS Control Tower
- **Accounts:** Management, Audit, Log Archive, Prod, Dev, Sandbox, Shared Services
- **Naming:** All accounts, OUs, and resources strictly follow the Naming Conventions guide (`va-[env]-[purpose]-acct`, etc.)
- **Domains:** Email routing and domain management via Route53 and WorkMail (e.g., prod@virtualagentics.ai)
- **SSO & Guardrails:** Centralized access (AWS SSO), baseline SCPs (region restrictions, MFA enforcement, etc.), AWS Config + CloudTrail org-level logging

### 4.2 Network Architecture

- **Addressing:** Explicit CIDR allocations for each VPC/subnet as per AWS_Addressing_Plan.md
- **Subnet Tiering:** Public, private, and isolated subnets per AZ, tagged by environment and purpose
- **Routing:** IGW for public, NAT for private, no external for isolated; route tables configured in Terraform
- **DNS:** Private hosted zones for internal resolution, public for external endpoints; certificates managed in ACM

### 4.3 Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform)
