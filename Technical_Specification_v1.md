# Technical Specification: Virtual Agentics Autonomous Company (v1.0)

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines the technical objectives, system requirements, and phased architectural approach for the Virtual Agentics project: an autonomous, AI-driven virtual enterprise built on cloud-native, agentic principles. The goal is to provide a reproducible blueprint for a modular, auditable, and revenue-generating AI business, with strict attention to automation, security, governance, and cost control.

## 2. Project Goals and Objectives

- **Create an autonomous multi-agent “virtual company”** capable of operating, adapting, and generating profit with minimal human oversight.
- **Implement all infrastructure and application code as IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code),** versioned and managed through CI/CD pipelines.
- **Emulate real-world corporate structure** with a CEO agent, C-level domain agents (e.g. CTO, CFO, CMO, CAgO), and department-specialized agents, all coordinated via event-driven protocols.
- **Adopt a phased, modular roadmap** allowing stepwise, auditable growth—prioritizing core foundation and iterative capability addition.
- **Enforce security, compliance, and auditability** as first principles, using strict naming conventions, role separation, and continuous monitoring.
- **Demonstrate financial sustainability,** capping initial cloud spend (target: €1,000/month), with dynamic scale-up contingent on profitability and real value creation.
- **Make the system open, extensible, and self-improving,** providing a reference model for others to replicate or extend.

## 3. Architectural Overview

### 3.1 High-Level System Design

- The system is a **hierarchical, event-driven, multi-agent architecture** running on AWS (with hybrid/on-prem as needed), using Terraform and GitHub Actions for full automation.
- Key architectural pillars:
  - **Landing Zone and AWS Organization:** Control Tower-provisioned, with Management, Audit, Log Archive, and workload accounts segmented by OU and environment (prod, dev, sandbox, shared services).
  - **Network Segmentation:** VPCs and subnets provisioned per the AWS Addressing Plan, using explicit CIDR blocks and subnet tiering (public/private/isolated).
  - **Agentic Layer:** AI agents implemented as serverless microservices (AWS Lambda) and later, containerized workloads (EKS, Fargate) for more persistent roles.
  - **State & Storage:** DynamoDB (single-table design), S3 buckets for content and artifacts, centralized Terraform state in S3 with DynamoDB locking.
  - **Event & Communication Bus:** Agents communicate asynchronously using event buses (SNS/SQS, EventBridge) and direct invocation as required. Events and message schema defined for all inter-agent protocols.
  - **Secrets & Credential Management:** AWS Secrets Manager is used for API keys and sensitive config, with rotation strategies defined.
  - **Observability & Compliance:** CloudWatch for logs/metrics, CloudTrail for audit, Config for compliance checks, Cost Explorer/Budgets for spend management.
  - **CI/CD Pipelines:** All changes (infra/app) deployed via GitHub Actions with OIDC-based role assumption; no static keys.

### 3.2 Hierarchical Multi-Agent Model

- **CEO Agent:** Sets high-level goals (e.g., “achieve €2K/month profit in 12 months”), approves strategic changes, reviews department outputs.
- **C-Level Domain Agents:** CAgO (Chief Agent Officer, workforce), CTO (infrastructure/DevOps), CFO (finance/trading), CMO/Data (marketing/analytics), others as project evolves.
- **Department Agents:** Specialized for HR (AI agent onboarding), R&D, Finance/Trading, Marketing, Compliance, and so on—each mapped to company-like workflows.
- **Agent Protocols:** All agent tasks, escalations, and collaboration flows are defined via documented event contracts and state transitions.
- **Memory & Learning:** Knowledge graph, vector DBs, and log-driven “organizational memory” are used for retrieval-augmented generation and long-term context.

### 3.3 Phased Roadmap and Milestones

| Phase  | Major Milestones                                                                                      |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Landing zone, network, account structure, naming, baseline IAM, remote Terraform backend, CI/CD, MVP agent(s) |
| 2      | Persistent data stores, advanced AI agent workflows, open-source model integration, SaaS/ML platform  |
| 3      | Departmental agent expansion (Finance, R&D, etc.), trading/revenue agents, learning and optimization  |
| 4      | Enterprise-scale, multi-cloud, high-availability, AI-driven self-improvement, regulatory readiness    |

## 4. Detailed Requirements by Subsystem

### 4.1 AWS Landing Zone & Organization

- **Tool:** AWS Control Tower
- **Accounts:** Management, Audit, Log Archive, Prod, Dev, Sandbox, Shared Services
- **Naming:** All accounts, OUs, and resources strictly follow the Naming Conventions guide (`va-[env]-[purpose]-acct`, etc.)
- **Domains:** Email routing and domain management via Route53 and WorkMail (e.g., prod@virtualagentics.ai)
- **SSO & Guardrails:** Centralized access (AWS SSO), baseline SCPs (region restrictions, MFA enforcement, etc.), AWS Config + CloudTrail org-level logging

### 4.2 Network Architecture

- **Addressing:** Explicit CIDR allocations for each VPC/subnet as per AWS_Addressing_Plan.md
- **Subnet Tiering:** Public, private, and isolated subnets per AZ, tagged by environment and purpose
- **Routing:** IGW for public, NAT for private, no external for isolated; route tables configured in Terraform
- **DNS:** Private hosted zones for internal resolution, public for external endpoints; certificates managed in ACM

### 4.3 Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform)

- **Project Structure:** Separate repositories for infra (`virtualagentics-iac`) and Lambda/app code (`virtualagentics-lambdas`)
- **Remote State:** S3 bucket (`va-prod-terraform-state-bucket`), DynamoDB lock table (`va-prod-terraform-lock`)
- **Modular Design:** Core modules for network, IAM, Lambda, DB, etc., following documented module layout
