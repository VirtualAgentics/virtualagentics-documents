# High-Level Framework: Virtual Agentics

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a high-level systems and process framework for the Virtual Agentics autonomous company. It describes how the project is decomposed into logical, modular, and auditable phases. The framework is designed to maximize traceability, reduce ambiguity, and ensure every component—from agent workflows to infrastructure and compliance—can be reasoned about, scaled, and improved autonomously.

---

## 2. Principles & Methodology

- **Phased Evolution:** Implementation is organized into phases that each lay a solid foundation for subsequent complexity. Nothing is skipped; each phase is a stable, validated platform for the next.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** All infrastructure is built, configured, and evolved using IaC (Terraform), versioned in Git, and deployed automatically through CI/CD.
- **Explicit Boundaries:** Each architectural component (network, identity, compute, agents, etc.) has a clear owner (human or agent), responsibility, and interface. Naming conventions, tagging, and resource boundaries are enforced everywhere.
- **Agentic Company Hierarchy:** All workflows, permissions, and communication mirror those of a structured, hierarchical company—CEO agent, CxO agents, department specialists—enforcing real-world-like governance, separation of duties, and escalation.
- **Automation-First:** No manual steps; all provisioning, agent onboarding, policy changes, and even much documentation are handled by automation (or by the AI agents themselves as capability increases).
- **Auditability & Compliance:** Everything is logged, monitored, and reportable. Cost, security, and operational compliance are part of every phase.

## 3. System Decomposition (Building Block Model)

The system is broken down into modular building blocks, each with well-defined inputs, outputs, and dependencies:

### a) Governance & Organizational Structure

- **Landing Zone:** AWS Control Tower-managed multi-account structure.
- **OUs/Accounts:** Segregation of environments and agent roles (prod, dev, audit, log archive, shared services).
- **SSO/IAM:** Federated access, minimal privileges, agent-specific roles, enforced MFA.

### b) Core Infrastructure

- **Networking:** Strict address management, tiered VPC/subnets (public/private/isolated), DNS, endpoint policies.
- **State & Storage:** Centralized state management (S3, DynamoDB), versioned and access controlled.
- **Secrets:** AWS Secrets Manager for all sensitive material, enforced rotation.
- **Remote Terraform Backend:** S3/DynamoDB-based state management for full team collaboration.

### c) Agent Platform Layer

- **Serverless Foundation:** Lambda for initial agents, with handler structure and CI/CD deployment.
- **Event Bus:** Agents communicate through defined event contracts (SNS/SQS/EventBridge).
- **Data Plane:** DynamoDB for fast, auditable, low-maintenance agent data and logging.
- **Agent Orchestration Frameworks:** Adopt specialized multi-agent orchestration frameworks such as CrewAI and AutoGen to enhance agent collaboration, autonomy, and efficiency.

### d) Observability & Control

- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch logs, alarms, dashboards for infra and agents.
- **Audit Trail:** CloudTrail, AWS Config, resource tagging.
- **Cost Management:** Tagging, budgets, and policy-based cost controls, with monitoring and automated reports.

### e) Expansion & Self-Improvement (Future Phases)

- **Self-Hosting Models:** Moving agent intelligence from external APIs to open-source LLMs/ML models.
- **Multi-Cloud/Resilience:** Adapting design for hybrid, cross-cloud, and on-prem components.
- **Self-Improving Agents:** Feedback loops, A/B testing, reinforcement learning, agent-driven infra changes.
- **Trading/Revenue Streams:** Integration of AI-driven trading, SaaS, and other revenue platforms as agentic departments.

## 4. Phased Delivery Roadmap

| Phase  | Timeline     | Foundation/Objective                                                                                                 |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Months 0-2   | Core AWS Org (Control Tower), networking, IAM, baseline CI/CD, naming conventions, first MVP agent(s)                |
| 2      | Months 3-6   | Persistent state, advanced AI workflow, SaaS/ML infra, core agentic platform, open-source model experimentation      |
| 3      | Months 7-12  | Department/vertical expansion: agentic trading, finance, marketing, compliance, research, and their governance       |
| 4      | Month 13+    | Multi-cloud scaling, advanced AI/ML pipelines, continuous learning, high-resilience, full agent self-management      |

Each phase:
- **Is explicitly documented** (requirements, outputs, lessons learned, rollback/DR).
- **Includes a technical checklist** and all configuration/scripts in version control.
- **Requires successful validation** and operational sign-off before the next begins.

---

## 5. Governance, Change, and Documentation Practices

- **Single Source of Truth:** Every architectural decision, convention, and artifact is versioned in the documentation repo (`VirtualAgentics/documents`).
- **Roles & Permissions:** Only authorized contributors can approve infrastructure or policy changes; agent onboarding is managed by HR agent role, infra by CTO agent.
- **Branching & Release:** Separate repositories for IaC and Lambda/app, branch protections on `main`, PR reviews required.
- **Traceable Change Logs:** All changes are logged, with rationale and link to requirements/issue for every merge.

---

## 6. Design Assurance & Review

- **Continuous Verification:** Automated testing and validation at every step (infra plan, policy, agent output).
- **Best Practices Embedded:** All components are built using AWS, IaC, and AI agent best practices—reviewed at each phase transition.
- **Lessons Learned:** Each phase ends with a retrospective (captured as `PhaseX_Overview.md` and checklist) to update future plans and documentation.
