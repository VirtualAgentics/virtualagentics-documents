2. Overview
2.1 Agent Purpose and Goals
The CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) agent autonomously plans and initiates content creation tasks by generating content request events. Its goal is to drive the content pipeline by scheduling and specifying new content topics, ensuring a steady flow of content aligned with marketing strategy in Phase 1.
2.2 Context within VirtualAgentics
Operates at the marketing strategy level, effectively acting as the “head of Marketing/Content”.
Triggers the content generation pipeline in tandem with the ContentGen, Review, and Publish agents.
Supports the company’s objective of an autonomous content pipeline by deciding what content should be created and when.
2.3 Scope & Assumptions
In scope:
Selecting or retrieving topics for new content (e.g. from a predefined list or simple algorithm).
Emitting content request events on a scheduled or on-demand basis to initiate content generation.
Out of scope:
Actual content generation or editing (handled by downstream agents).
Dynamic market analysis or complex strategy adjustments (Phase 1 uses static or pre-configured content plans).
Human approval or manual intervention in content topic selection (fully automated in Phase 1).
2.4 Dependencies
Upstream: None (acts as a pipeline initiator; triggers are internal schedule or simple rules, not events from other agents in Phase 1).
Downstream: Publishes ContentRequest events consumed by the ContentGen agent. This kicks off the content generation workflow.
External: None in Phase 1 (topic selection is based on static configuration or basic logic). Future phases may integrate external trend analytics or SEO tools, but not in Phase 1.
3. Architecture & System Context
3.1 High-Level Context Diagram
(Diagram to be inserted) – The CMO agent is an AWS Lambda function that triggers the content pipeline. It has no incoming event source in Phase 1 other than a scheduled trigger, and it publishes to an Amazon SNS topic that the ContentGen agent subscribes to. The CMO agent does not directly interact with databases or external services in the initial implementation.
3.2 Deployment Target
Platform: AWS Lambda (Python 3.11 runtime)
Environment: Deployed to both development and production AWS environments (VPC access not required if only using AWS services internally).
3.3 Runtime Environment & Resource Profile
Memory: 256 MB (Lambda memory allocation)
Timeout: 30 seconds (Lambda execution timeout)
Concurrency: 2 (default Lambda concurrency limit, though typically only one invocation runs at a time for scheduled triggers).
Invocation Trigger: AWS EventBridge Scheduler (e.g. cron schedule) or manual trigger for testing.
4. Interfaces
4.1 Event-Driven Interfaces
4.1.1 Subscribed Events
N/A. The CMO agent is not triggered by any incoming event in Phase 1. It operates on a schedule or internal logic rather than subscribing to another agent’s events.
4.1.2 Published Events
| Event Name | Topic | Payload Schema | Destination(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ContentRequest | /content/request | content-request-v1.json | ContentGen agent (via SNS) |

ContentRequest: This event contains a new content request with fields such as the content_topic, desired word_count, and any optional context. It is published to the content request topic, which the ContentGen agent listens on.
4.2 Synchronous APIs / Webhooks
None. The CMO agent does not expose any direct API endpoints or webhooks in Phase 1 (its functionality is entirely event/schedule-driven).
4.3 Data-Store Interfaces
No direct data store interactions in Phase 1. The CMO agent’s content ideas or schedule are configured internally (e.g. via environment variables or static configuration). It does not read from or write to databases in this phase. (Future versions might use a DynamoDB table for content calendar or a backlog of ideas, but not currently.)
4.4 External Service Calls
None in Phase 1. The CMO agent does not call external APIs. All logic is internal or configuration-driven. (In future phases, it may integrate with external trend analysis or SEO keyword APIs to inform content strategy.)
5. Inputs & Outputs
5.1 Input Catalogue
The CMO agent does not consume any input payload via events. Its input is effectively the scheduled trigger and internal configuration.
| Name | Format | Source | Required | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (No external inputs) | – | – | – | – |

(The agent’s operation is driven by schedule; it has no event-based input parameters.)
5.2 Output Catalogue
The outputs of the CMO agent are new content requests to initiate the pipeline.
| Name | Format | Destination | Consumer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| event:ContentRequest | Event | SNS topic /content/request | ContentGen agent |

ContentRequest event: An SNS event containing details for content generation (e.g. topic, desired length). This event is picked up by the ContentGen agent to start the content creation process.
5.3 Error/Exception Outputs
Although rare, the CMO agent could encounter errors (for example, if it fails to publish an SNS message). In such cases, it emits an error event for observability.
| Error Name | Format | Output | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RequestFailure | Event | SNS /content/errors | Emitted if the agent fails to create or publish a ContentRequest event (includes error details). |

(On a RequestFailure, the error event contains the reason (exception message, etc.). In Phase 1 there may be no automated consumer for this error event aside from logging/monitoring.)
6. Internal Processing Logic
6.1 Processing Flow Diagram / Pseudocode
On scheduled trigger (e.g. cron):
Select a content topic for the new article. (e.g. from a configured list or simple rotation logic)
Determine content parameters: e.g. assign a target word_count (using a default or rule) and any context if available.
Construct the ContentRequest event payload (JSON) with the chosen content_topic, word_count, etc.
Publish the ContentRequest event to the /content/request SNS topic.
Log the request (topic and word count) for auditing. If publishing to SNS fails, capture the exception for error handling.
6.2 Key Algorithms or Decision Logic
Topic Selection: Uses a simple strategy (e.g. round-robin through a predefined list of SEO keywords or blog topics). For Phase 1, the list of topics might be hard-coded or provided via configuration. Example: cycling through ["AI in Marketing", "Autonomous Agents 101", "AI Trends 2025", ...].
Scheduling Frequency: Configured to run at a fixed interval (for example, once per day at 9am).
Content Parameters: Uses default values for certain fields. For instance, a default word_count (e.g. 800 words) may be applied uniformly, and no complex context is added in Phase 1.
6.3 Configuration Parameters
TOPIC_LIST: Predefined list of content topics or a reference to where to fetch topics (if stored externally).
DEFAULT_WORD_COUNT: Default number of words for each article (e.g. 800).
SCHEDULE_CRON: The cron expression or schedule frequency (managed in infrastructure, e.g. EventBridge Scheduler).
(No secrets or API keys required in Phase 1 for this agent.)
6.4 Resource Utilization Expectations
CPU: Minimal – selects a topic and sends an event (negligible computation).
Memory: Very low usage (< 50 MB typical) out of 256 MB allocated.
Network I/O: Minimal – one outbound SNS publish call per execution.
Execution time: Typically under 0.5 seconds per invocation (just constructing and sending an event).
7. Lifecycle Management
7.1 Initialization / Startup
On cold start, load configuration (topic list, etc.) from environment or file if applicable.
No external connections or secrets to fetch. (Warm-up is trivial for this agent.)
Log an initialization message indicating the agent is ready (for debugging cold starts).
7.2 Runtime Behavior Loop
The CMO Lambda is invoked on a schedule. It is a stateless single-run invocation that immediately performs the steps to emit a content request, then exits.
There is no persistent loop; each scheduled run is independent. The agent does not maintain state between invocations beyond what’s in configuration.
7.3 Error Handling & Recovery
If an error occurs during execution (e.g. exception while publishing to SNS), the Lambda will catch the exception.
In case of failure to publish event, the agent emits a RequestFailure error event (as described in 5.3) and logs the error.
AWS Lambda will automatically retry on errors if configured via the EventBridge trigger (by default, EventBridge may retry an errored invocation once). The agent itself does not implement internal retry loops (the operation is simple).
A dead-letter queue (DLQ) can be configured on the SNS or Lambda to catch any ContentRequest events that fail to be delivered, but given this agent’s role, primary error reporting is via CloudWatch logs and the error event.
7.4 State Transitions & Persistence
State: The CMO agent is stateless across invocations. It does not persist any dynamic state in Phase 1.
Persistence: Not applicable. (Any needed persistence like remembering used topics would be part of external storage, which Phase 1 does not implement. Repeated invocations operate on the same static list or logic without memory of previous picks, unless the logic itself encodes order.)
7.5 Shutdown / Termination
The Lambda simply terminates after execution. There are no open resources that require cleanup (no open network sockets aside from the SNS call which completes).
If the function is being decommissioned or replaced, no special offboarding steps are needed other than removing the schedule trigger.
7.6 Upgrade & Blue/Green Deployment Considerations
Deployed via CI/CD with versioned Lambda artifacts. New versions can be published and the alias (e.g. “prod”) shifted to the new version for blue/green deployment.
Since the agent runs on a schedule, coordinating cut-over simply means the new code will execute on the next scheduled invocation once the alias is updated. (No long-lived process to drain.)
Rollback is straightforward: re-point the alias to the previous Lambda version if an issue is discovered.
8. Security & Compliance
8.1 IAM Role and Least-Privilege Policy Summary
The CMO Lambda runs with an IAM role granting the minimum necessary permissions:
Allow: sns:Publish to the content request SNS topic (ARN for /content/request).
Allow: logs:CreateLogStream, logs:PutLogEvents for its CloudWatch Logs (standard for Lambdas).
Deny/No access to any other AWS resources not required (no DynamoDB or S3 access needed in Phase 1).
Resource scope is restricted to the specific SNS topic ARN and the function’s log group.
8.2 Secrets Management
No secrets are used by the CMO agent in Phase 1. All configuration is non-sensitive (topics, numbers) and provided via environment variables or code. (If in future the agent integrates with external APIs, appropriate secrets management via AWS Secrets Manager would be introduced.)
8.3 Data Classification & Encryption
The content topics and requests generated are not sensitive (they are intended for public content), but all communications are still encrypted in transit. The SNS event payloads travel over AWS’s internal network (TLS secured).
No data is stored persistently by this agent. (Any future data stores like DynamoDB or S3 for topics would be encrypted at rest by AWS-managed keys by default.)
8.4 Audit Logging Requirements
Every invocation and action is logged to CloudWatch Logs, including the content topic chosen and confirmation of publishing the event.
If an event fails to publish, the error and exception stack trace are logged.
CloudTrail will record the SNS publish API call made by the Lambda (for auditing).
Monitoring systems can be set to alert on anomalies (though specifics are in Observability/Alerting).
9. Observability
9.1 Logging
The CMO agent employs structured logging via AWS Lambda’s logging to CloudWatch:
Logs include timestamp, a unique request ID, and key event details (e.g. “ContentRequest published for topic X with word_count Y”).
No PII or sensitive data is handled by this agent, and logs reflect only operational data (topics, statuses).
Errors are logged with severity ERROR, including exception messages for troubleshooting.
9.2 Metrics
Key CloudWatch custom metrics (namespace VirtualAgentics/CMO) include:
CMO.RequestCount – incremented each time a ContentRequest event is successfully published.
CMO.FailureCount – incremented on any execution failure (exception caught, event not published).
CMO.LastRunTime – the execution duration of the last run (for example, to monitor if runtime is within expected bounds, typically a few hundred milliseconds).
9.3 Distributed Tracing
[Optional] AWS X-Ray tracing can be enabled on the Lambda if end-to-end tracing is desired. In Phase 1, this is not enabled by default (since the flow is simple), but X-Ray could help trace the event as it moves from CMO to ContentGen if configured.
9.4 Alert Thresholds & Destinations
An alert is configured if FailureCount > 0 in a given day (indicating the CMO agent failed to send a content request). This could trigger an SNS notification or PagerDuty alert to the on-call engineer.
Additionally, if no ContentRequest events have been published in an expected time frame (e.g. none in 24 hours when one per day is expected), an alert could be raised to signal a potential schedule or agent failure.
All alerts are sent to the operations notification channel (e.g. an email or Slack integration for the devops team).
10. Performance & Scaling
10.1 Expected Workload Profile
Frequency: Approximately 1 content request per day in normal operation (configurable). During testing or initial ramp-up, there may be a few requests per day, but volume is low.
Peak Load: In an extreme scenario (e.g. manual trigger or backlog flush), up to 10 content requests might be issued in a short period (burst within a minute), but this is not typical. The Lambda and SNS can handle this burst easily.
Overall Phase 1 Volume: On the order of 10–50 content requests per week (matching the planned content output of the system).
10.2 Latency & Throughput Targets
Latency: The agent should complete its execution and publish the event in under 1 second on average. This ensures minimal delay in starting content generation after a scheduled trigger.
Throughput: Not a limiting factor here – even at burst, 10 events/minute is well within AWS SNS and Lambda throughput capabilities.
10.3 Auto-Scaling and Concurrency
The Lambda can scale horizontally if multiple triggers occur close together, but by design only one scheduled invocation happens at a time. The default concurrency limit of 2 is more than sufficient in Phase 1.
If content requests were ever triggered by external events or multiple parallel schedules, the Lambda concurrency could be increased. In the current implementation, no auto-scaling triggers beyond the base Lambda behavior are needed.
The SNS service can easily handle the volume of messages; no special scaling concerns there.
11. Testing Strategy
11.1 Unit Tests
Topic Selection Logic: Validate that the agent correctly selects a topic from the configured list (and moves to the next as expected on subsequent runs, if applicable). For example, ensure if the topic list is empty or null, the agent handles it gracefully.
Event Payload Formation: Unit-test the function that constructs the ContentRequest payload. Given a sample topic and word_count, verify that the JSON matches the content-request-v1.json schema (fields present and correctly named).
SNS Publish Call: Use mocking to simulate the AWS SNS client. Confirm that the code calls Publish with the correct topic ARN and message. Check that the message structure (JSON string) contains the expected content.
Error Handling: Force error scenarios (e.g. simulate SNS publish throwing an exception) and ensure the function catches the exception and would emit a RequestFailure event (which can be verified via a mocked SNS for the error topic or by inspecting logs in the test).
11.2 Integration Tests
End-to-End Scheduled Run (Dev Environment): Deploy the CMO Lambda in a dev environment with a daily schedule but manually trigger it for test. Upon invocation, verify that a ContentRequest SNS message is published. Then confirm the ContentGen dev instance received or processed that event (this can be verified by checking that ContentGen produced a ContentReady event or log).
SNS End-to-End Test: In a controlled test environment, subscribe a test queue or Lambda to the /content/request SNS topic. Manually invoke the CMO Lambda (e.g. via AWS Console or CLI). Assert that the test subscriber receives exactly one ContentRequest event with the expected payload fields.
Config Variation Test: Change the configuration (e.g. different default word_count or a different topic list) in a test deployment and ensure the agent uses the updated values in the emitted events.
11.3 Contract Tests
Input Contract: Not applicable (no input events). However, if using a schedule, verify the EventBridge trigger does not send any unexpected payload that could break the Lambda (the Lambda currently ignores any input payload from the scheduler).
Output Contract: Validate that the ContentRequest events produced conform strictly to content-request-v1.json schema. This includes required fields like content_topic and word_count. In a test, one can capture the event JSON and run it against the JSON schema to ensure compliance.
11.4 Load & Stress Tests
Although the normal load is low, test the agent’s behavior under a burst scenario: e.g. invoke the Lambda 5–10 times in quick succession (simulating an scenario where multiple content pieces are triggered). Ensure each invocation publishes its event without interference (the Lambda should handle this, as each invocation is isolated).
Check AWS CloudWatch metrics during this burst: all invocations should succeed and RequestCount metric should equal the number of invocations, with no throttling or errors.
Test the system with a long list of topics to ensure the selection logic doesn’t degrade in performance (e.g. 1000 topics list still results in sub-second execution).
12. Operational Runbooks
12.1 Standard Deployment Steps
Code changes are committed to the repository. A pull request is reviewed and approved by the engineering team.
Upon merge to the main branch, the CI/CD pipeline runs. This includes running all tests (unit/integration) for the CMO agent. Tests must pass before deployment.
An automated GitHub Actions workflow (or similar CI tool) packages the CMO Lambda code and deploys it to AWS (using Terraform or CloudFormation as per infrastructure-as-code setup).
The deployment includes configuring the EventBridge schedule in the target environment (Dev or Prod) and pointing it to the new Lambda version/alias.
Post-deployment, verify in CloudWatch that the CMO Lambda was invoked at the expected next schedule interval successfully.
12.2 Rollback Procedure
If an issue is discovered with a new deployment (e.g. the CMO agent fails to publish events), the quick rollback is to redeploy the previous stable Lambda version. Because Lambda supports versioning, the operations team can update the alias (e.g. “prod”) to point back to the last known good version. This effectively restores the previous code without needing a new code push.
Alternatively, revert the code change in Git (or fix it), and run the deployment pipeline to deploy a new stable version.
Since content scheduling is time-sensitive (we don’t want to miss days), a rollback should be done within the same day of detecting a fault. The system can tolerate a short pause (worst case one missed content day) but prompt correction is ideal.
12.3 Common Incident Diagnostics
Missing ContentRequest Events: If the pipeline stops receiving ContentRequest events, first check CloudWatch Logs for the CMO Lambda around the expected invocation times. Filter logs for errors: e.g. filter @message "ERROR" to see if any exceptions occurred.
SNS Delivery Issues: If the CMO logs indicate success but downstream didn’t get the event, verify the SNS topic configuration and subscription (ContentGen subscription to /content/request). Check SNS metrics for published message count versus delivered.
Schedule Issues: If the Lambda was not invoked at all, confirm the EventBridge schedule is active and the Lambda is properly associated. The CloudWatch Logs may have no entries which hints at schedule misconfiguration or the Lambda being disabled.
High FailureCount Alert: In case of an alert (FailureCount > 0), examine the specific error in logs. Common issues could be IAM permission errors (SNS publish denied) or misconfigured topic ARN. Address the root cause (e.g. fix IAM policy or topic name).
General: Use CloudWatch Logs Insights to search across multiple invocations if needed (by time range) to spot any patterns or recurring warnings.
12.4 Known Limitations
Static Strategy: The CMO agent in Phase 1 uses a simplistic content strategy (static list of topics and fixed scheduling). It does not react to real-time marketing data or performance feedback.
No Dynamic Adaptation: It won’t stop or adjust content requests based on content performance or external events (this is left for future improvements).
Single Pipeline Focus: The agent assumes a single content pipeline. If multiple parallel content campaigns or types were needed, the current design would need extension (e.g. multiple topic lists or different kinds of requests).
Schedule Rigidity: The schedule is fixed at deployment time. There is no user-friendly interface to change how often or when it runs short of updating the infrastructure config (which requires engineering intervention).
13. Future Enhancements
13.1 Planned Phase 2+ Capabilities
Intelligent Topic Generation: Integrate an AI service or data pipeline to generate content ideas dynamically (e.g. analyzing trending keywords, Google Trends, or company product updates). The CMO agent could then create ContentRequests based on real-time data rather than a static list.
Feedback Loop Integration: In future phases, the CMO agent might consume analytics events (e.g. how published content performs) to prioritize or adjust content topics. For example, if certain topics drive more traffic (data possibly provided by a CFO or Analytics agent), the CMO could request more content in that area.
Multiple Campaign Management: Extend the agent to handle multiple content campaigns or categories simultaneously, each with its own schedule and topic sources (requiring more complex internal logic and configurations).
Coordination with CEO Agent: If a CEO agent exists to set high-level goals (e.g. increase traffic by X%), the CMO agent could take strategic directives and translate them into content production goals (e.g. schedule more content or adjust topics to meet a traffic goal).
13.2 Technical Debt & Refactor Candidates
Configuration Management: Refactor how topic lists and schedules are managed. Instead of hardcoded or manually configured lists, move to a managed data store (with an interface for marketing to update topics without code changes). This reduces the technical debt of having to redeploy for topic changes.
Error Handling & Retries: Currently relies on very simple error handling. In the future, implement more robust retry logic for SNS publishing (though SNS rarely fails) or an alerting mechanism if a scheduled run is missed.
Generalization: The agent could be refactored to a more generic “Task Scheduler” for the company’s autonomous processes. While it currently is specific to content requests, a more flexible design could allow it to schedule different types of requests, improving reuse.
Logging Consistency: Ensure the logging format and structure is consistent with other agents (this may involve refactoring the log messages or introducing a common logging library across agents for uniformity).
