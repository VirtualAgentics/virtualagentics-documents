# System Architecture Overview: Virtual Agentics

## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive, version-controlled overview of the Virtual Agentics technical architecture, with references to all major system diagrams and plain-English descriptions for each architectural layer and phase.

---

## 1. Building Block Model

Virtual Agentics is a **modular, phased, agentic AI enterprise** running on a hybrid cloud-native stack. All infrastructure is defined as code, with strict governance and auditability at every layer.

---

## 2. Key Architectural Diagrams

All referenced diagrams are available in the `/images/` subfolder.

### a) **Building_Block_Architecture.png**
> *Shows the initial system decomposition: AWS accounts, VPCs, core CI/CD, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM, and DNS. Highlights clean separation of concerns and direct alignment to organizational structure (management, prod, dev, shared, audit, log archive).*

### b) **Structured_Final_Architecture.png**
> *Depicts Phase 2/3 target: multi-agent orchestration, persistent vector DB, open-source LLM hosting, core SaaS endpoints, knowledge graph integration, event-driven agent communication (SNS/SQS/EventBridge), and robust observability (CloudWatch, CloudTrail, budget alarms).*

### c) **Detailed_Final_Architecture.png**
> *Shows Phase 3/4 target: departmentalized agent clusters, agentic trading, real-time revenue pipelines, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), advanced compliance/guardrails, disaster recovery, and cross-cloud/region extension.*

### d) **VirtualAgentics_Architecture_Diagram.png**
> *A single high-level view, suitable for stakeholder and partner presentations, linking business functions to the underlying technical building blocks. Labels all major integration points, shared services, and boundaries.*

## 3. Architectural Layers

### a) Organizational Governance

- **AWS Control Tower:** Multi-account landing zone, OUs for prod/dev/shared/sandbox, management, audit, log archive accounts.
- **Naming/Tagging:** Strict, per [Naming_Conventions.md](Naming_Conventions.md), with full traceability.

### b) Core Infrastructure

- **Networking:** Explicit VPC/subnet structure per [AWS_Addressing_Plan.md](AWS_Addressing_Plan.md). Three-tier subnets, non-overlapping CIDRs, private/public isolation, internal DNS.
- **IAM:** Least-privilege, per-environment roles; all managed via Terraform.
- **Secrets Management:** AWS Secrets Manager for all sensitive material, with automated rotation and audit.

### c) Application/Agent Platform

- **Lambda Functions:** All Phase 1 agents are AWS Lambda-based microservices, managed as code and deployed via CI/CD.
- **State:** Single-table DynamoDB, S3 buckets (content, artifacts, static website).
- **Orchestration:** Event-driven agent communication (SNS/SQS/EventBridge); CrewAI/LangGraph introduced in Phase 2+ for advanced multi-agent workflows.
- **Vector DB & RAG:** Phase 2+ introduces Pinecone, Qdrant, or equivalent for agentic memory/semantic search.

### d) SaaS, API, and Web

- **API Gateway:** Exposes public/internal endpoints; mapped to agents for SaaS or data services.
- **Static Website:** Hugo-based site generator pipeline, S3/CloudFront for hosting and distribution.
- **DNS/SSL:** Route53 zones per environment, ACM wildcard certificates.

### e) Observability, Security, and Compliance

- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch metrics/logs/alarms, dashboards, CloudTrail auditing, Config rules, backup/DR per [Monitoring_and_Alerting.md](Monitoring_and_Alerting.md).
- **Cost Controls:** Budget alarms, tagging, and [Cost_Management_and_Optimization.md](Cost_Management_and_Optimization.md) controls.
- **Compliance:** SCPs, encryption, policy enforcement per [Compliance_and_Security_Policies.md](Compliance_and_Security_Policies.md).

## 4. Phase Progression

| Phase   | Key Technical Milestones                                                                             |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1 | AWS org/landing zone, VPCs, IAM, Terraform backend, first Lambda agents, baseline CI/CD, monitoring |
| Phase 2 | Multi-agent orchestration, persistent vector DB, open-source LLMs, RAG, SaaS endpoints, agent APIs  |
| Phase 3 | Departmental agent clusters, trading/revenue agents, in-house model hosting, adaptive improvement   |
| Phase 4 | Enterprise-scale, multi-cloud, fully autonomous agentic company, dynamic infra self-management      |

Each diagram referenced above is annotated and linked as the system evolves. For each phase, supporting docs and configs are versioned in the repo for full traceability.
