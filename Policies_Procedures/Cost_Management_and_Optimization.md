# Cost Management and Optimization: Virtual Agentics

## Purpose

This document establishes the cost management strategy, controls, and optimization procedures for Virtual Agentics across all AWS accounts and external SaaS/platform usage. Its goal is to ensure financial sustainability, prevent overruns, and support continuous cost/performance improvement.

---

## 1. Principles

- **Budget-first:** Cloud and platform spend is capped (initially €1,000/month), never increased unless directly justified by recurring revenue.
- **Tagging for accountability:** All resources must be tagged with owner, environment, and purpose.
- **Cost visibility:** All teams have dashboards, budgets, and anomaly alerts; transparency is required for all new deployments.

---

## 2. Core Cost Controls

### a) AWS Budgets and Alarms

- **Budgets:** Set at organization, account, and project level; enforced for prod, dev, and sandbox OUs
- **Alarms:** Email/Slack/SNS alerts on 70%, 90%, and 100% of budget
- **Daily checks:** Lambda or scheduled process checks and notifies on cost/usage spikes

### b) Resource Tagging

- **All AWS resources**: Tagged with `Project`, `Owner`, `Environment`, `Purpose` (see [Naming_Conventions.md](../Naming_Conventions.md))
- **Tag-based cost allocation:** Used for reporting, chargebacks, and cost optimization efforts

### c) External/SaaS Cost Monitoring

- **All paid APIs and SaaS (OpenAI, vector DBs, email, etc.)**: Usage logged and costs tracked; monthly spend reviewed
- **Thresholds set**: For API token usage and rate limits to prevent runaway spend
- **Onboard new services only with cost review**

---

## 3. Optimization Procedures

### a) Rightsizing and Automation

- **Auto-stop/scale-down** for unused dev/test resources (e.g., test Lambdas, dev EC2)
- **Use of on-demand/spot/Graviton** where suitable
- **Always prefer serverless/managed services** for elastic scaling to zero

### b) Deletion/Archive Policy

- **Orphaned resources:** Deleted within 7 days unless owner provides business justification
- **Old Lambda versions, S3 objects, backups:** Lifecycle policies applied; archive to Glacier or delete

### c) SaaS/Third-party Optimization

- **Review API plan/usage monthly:** Downscale if usage is below plan
- **Move to open-source/self-hosted** as soon as cost effective (e.g., LLM hosting instead of OpenAI API)

---

## 4. Cost Reporting and Governance

- **Monthly cost reports:** Automated via Cost Explorer, tagged for team/department/agent accountability
- **Quarterly review:** CFO Agent and engineering meet to review, approve, and adjust cost allocations
- **Cost policies:** Documented in this file; changes require C-level and cost owner approval

---

## 5. Automated Guardrails

- **Terraform policies:** Prevent creation of high-cost instance types or services unless justified/approved
- **Budget alarms:** Block pipeline or notify team if monthly spend exceeds set threshold
- **SaaS API limits:** Fail gracefully and alert if usage approaches cap

---

## 6. Exceptions and Change Control

- Any budget or resource exceptions must be documented in this file, with rationale, date, and C-level approval.
- All cost policies are version-controlled and changes reviewed quarterly.
