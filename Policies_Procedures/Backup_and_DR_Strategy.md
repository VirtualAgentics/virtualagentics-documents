# Backup and Disaster Recovery Strategy: Virtual Agentics

## Purpose

This document defines the policies, mechanisms, and responsibilities for backup and disaster recovery (DR) in the Virtual Agentics cloud environments. It ensures business continuity, compliance, and auditability for all critical data, infrastructure, and agent workflows.

---

## 1. Principles and Objectives

- **All critical data is backed up, versioned, and recoverable.**
- **Restore Point Objective (RPO):** ≤ 24 hours (configurable by data class)
- **Restore Time Objective (RTO):** ≤ 4 hours (or as dictated by data criticality)
- **Zero tolerance for data loss** on configuration, infrastructure code, or audit logs

---

## 2. Scope and Coverage

- **Covered Data/Resources:**
  - DynamoDB tables (agent state, single-table design)
  - S3 buckets (content, website, deployment artifacts)
  - Lambda code/config (via CI/CD artifacts, GitHub versioning)
  - IAM and resource configuration (tracked in Terraform, GitHub)
  - CloudWatch logs, CloudTrail, Config rules
  - Route53 DNS records and WorkMail/SES configurations

---

## 3. Backup Procedures

### a) DynamoDB

- **Point-in-time recovery (PITR):** Enabled on all production tables
- **On-demand snapshots:** Weekly and before major deployments/infra changes
- **Restore tested quarterly**

### b) S3 Buckets

- **Versioning:** Enabled on all buckets (`va-prod-content-bucket`, `va-prod-website-bucket`, etc.)
- **Lifecycle rules:** 
  - Retain versions for 90 days, archive to Glacier after 30 days
  - Expire/delete incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days
- **Cross-region replication:** Optional for critical content and configuration buckets

### c) Lambda Code and Config

- **All code and config is Git-tracked:** Restoration possible from last known good commit
- **CI/CD artifacts:** Build output stored in S3 with retention policy

### d) Configuration/Infra

- **Terraform state:** Remote S3 bucket with versioning; daily snapshot to secondary bucket
- **State lock table (DynamoDB):** Included in table backup rotation

### e) Logs and Audit

- **CloudWatch Logs:** Export to S3 monthly; retained for 1 year
- **CloudTrail/Config:** Logs centralized in Log Archive account, retained for 3+ years for compliance

---

## 4. Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan

### a) DR Scenarios

- **AWS Region failure:** Data and workloads can be restored in a secondary region (manual or scripted failover)
- **Account compromise:** Immediate lockdown, use of DR accounts and out-of-band access; restore from backup
- **Critical data loss/corruption:** Restore from last backup/snapshot; investigate root cause
- **Configuration drift or IaC disaster:** Restore from GitHub and S3 state; apply from last good commit/tag

### b) DR Runbook (Summary)

1. **Declare incident:** Escalate to CTO and incident response team
2. **Identify affected resources and data classes**
3. **Restore from latest backup (DynamoDB/S3/snapshots) or code/artifacts**
4. **Validate system and data integrity**
5. **Resume operations and document root cause/lessons learned**
6. **Audit all DR actions for compliance**

---

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Ops/Engineering:** Schedule, test, and validate backups; document procedures
- **Security/Compliance:** Audit logs, ensure policy adherence, monitor RPO/RTO metrics
- **All teams:** Report anomalies, test restores quarterly, ensure IaC/infra changes are PR-reviewed

---

## 6. Automation, Monitoring, and Audit

- **All backups automated** via AWS Backup, scheduled Lambda, or IaC scripts
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch alarms on backup failures, low storage, DR events
- **Auditability:** All backup/restore actions logged and reviewed in DR/Compliance meetings

---

## 7. Exceptions and Change Control

- Any exceptions or changes to this policy must be reviewed and documented in this file with rationale, date, and approval.
- All DR test results and lessons learned appended as change log entries.
