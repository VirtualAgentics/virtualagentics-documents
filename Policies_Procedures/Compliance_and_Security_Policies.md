# Compliance and Security Policies: Virtual Agentics

## Purpose

This document defines all security, compliance, privacy, and operational controls required for Virtual Agentics’ AWS cloud environments, agentic infrastructure, and data workflows. It is the authoritative reference for both engineering and audit teams.

---

## 1. Principles

- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple, layered controls protect all resources, credentials, and data.
- **Least Privilege:** All IAM permissions and roles are strictly minimized.
- **Compliance by Default:** Controls are automated and enforced from inception, not as afterthoughts.
- **Auditability:** All critical actions, changes, and events are logged and reviewed.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Security and compliance posture is continuously monitored, tested, and updated.

---

## 2. Regulatory Alignment

- **GDPR:** All personal data (if any) stored, processed, or transmitted is subject to GDPR controls: consent, right-to-erasure, data residency, and breach notification.
- **AWS Well-Architected:** All systems reviewed against AWS Well-Architected Framework (especially Security and Operational Excellence pillars).
- **Audit-Ready:** Controls and logs are sufficient for external audit by regulators or partners.

---

## 3. Core Security Controls

### a) Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- **Role-based access:** Only required users/agents have AWS access; human and machine users segregated.
- **MFA required:** All privileged access (console, CLI, SSO) enforces MFA.
- **No root usage:** Root user used only for account bootstrap, with strong, rotated password, and MFA enabled.
- **Least privilege IAM policies:** All Lambda, CI/CD, and agent roles only have explicitly required permissions; regular reviews for permission creep.
- **No long-lived access keys:** All credentials are short-lived; OIDC preferred for CI/CD.

### b) Network and Data Protection

- **VPC isolation:** Prod, dev, shared, and sandbox workloads strictly separated (see [AWS_Addressing_Plan.md](../AWS_Addressing_Plan.md)).
- **No public access:** No S3 buckets or databases exposed to the public internet.
- **TLS everywhere:** All data in transit is encrypted via TLS 1.2+.
- **Encryption at rest:** S3, DynamoDB, EBS, and RDS all use AWS-managed or customer-managed KMS keys.
- **Secrets Management:** All credentials, tokens, and sensitive configs stored in AWS Secrets Manager; never hardcoded.

### c) Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting


## VPC Flow Logs Configuration

VPC Flow Logs are **enabled** for the production VPC and other critical subnets in Phase 1. These logs are delivered to our central Log Archive account's S3 bucket to facilitate continuous monitoring, security auditing, and operational troubleshooting.


- **CloudTrail enabled** org-wide; logs centralized and stored in Log Archive account.
- **CloudWatch and AWS Config** monitor all resource changes, failures, and misconfigurations.
- **Automated alarms:** Triggered on errors, unauthorized changes, or unusual activity.
- **Audit log retention:** Logs kept ≥ 3 years for compliance.

### d) Data Management

- **Backups:** All data and config regularly backed up and tested (see [Backup_and_DR_Strategy.md](../Backup_and_DR_Strategy.md)).
- **Data retention/deletion:** Data is retained no longer than necessary; deletion is tested and auditable.
- **Data residency:** No personal data leaves approved regions (default: `eu-central-1`).

### e) Agentic Security

- **Agent actions logged:** All significant agent operations and decisions are logged with agent ID, timestamp, and rationale.
- **Agent onboarding/offboarding:** Only via HR/CAgO agent and documented process; permissions reviewed at creation/termination.

### f) Change Management

- **All infrastructure and policy changes via PR and code review.**
- **Terraform and IaC required:** No manual console changes except in emergencies (must be backported).
- **Change log:** Every change is logged with rationale, reviewer, and impact.

---

## 4. Compliance and Policy Enforcement

- **Service Control Policies (SCPs):** Block forbidden actions (e.g., resource creation in unapproved regions, disabling CloudTrail).
- **Automated config rules:** Enforce tagging, encryption, backup, and log retention policies.
- **Budget and cost controls:** Alarms on budget thresholds, explicit approval for cost-increasing actions.
- **Audit process:** Quarterly security reviews, penetration tests, and compliance reviews.

---

## 5. Incident Response

- **Automated detection:** Alarms for security anomalies, credential leaks, and unusual API activity.
- **Response plan:** All incidents escalated to Security and CTO; root cause documented and fixes reviewed.
- **Breach notification:** If personal data affected, follow GDPR notification timelines and protocols.

---

## 6. Training, Awareness, and Continuous Improvement

- **Mandatory security training:** For all engineers and agentic policy creators.
- **Regular tabletop exercises:** Run simulated breaches and recovery at least annually.
- **Continuous updates:** Policy reviewed quarterly and on any material change in risk or scope.

---

## 7. Exceptions and Change Control

- All exceptions to this policy must be documented here, with rationale, approval, and mitigation plan.
- Changes must be PR’d, reviewed, and versioned in this document.
