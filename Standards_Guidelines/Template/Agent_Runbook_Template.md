# Operational Runbook Template

This document is a standardized template for documenting **operational procedures for a VirtualAgentics agent**. It ensures consistent and thorough operational readiness documentation for every Phase 1 agent.  
*Fill in all placeholders (e.g., `<AGENT_NAME>`, `<...>`) with specific details for your agent.*

---

## 1. Overview and Context

Describe the agent in question and its role within the system.

- `<AGENT_NAME>` – Brief description of the agent’s purpose and how it fits into the system.
- Include any necessary context: Is this agent part of the Phase 1 pipeline? What critical function does it serve?
- *(Replace this description with the actual context of your agent.)*

---

## 2. Deployment and Release Procedures

### 2.1 Deployment Pipeline

- Describe how `<AGENT_NAME>` is built, tested, and deployed (e.g., via Terraform scripts, GitHub Actions pipeline).
- Indicate the CI/CD process and any manual steps required.

### 2.2 Configuration Management

- List any environment variables, feature flags, or configuration files needed for `<AGENT_NAME>`, and how to update them.
- Note any secrets handling or permissions for updating configuration.

### 2.3 Rollback Procedure

- If a new release causes failures, describe how to revert to the last known good version (rollback Terraform, redeploy previous Lambda code, etc.).
- Note any approval steps or communication required for a rollback.
- *(Document the rollback process step-by-step.)*

---

## 3. Monitoring and Alerts

### 3.1 Logs and Metrics

- Identify the key logs and metrics for `<AGENT_NAME>`.
  - Example: CloudWatch Logs group name, log formats, custom metrics (error rate, invocation count, latency).
- List the expected log sources and how to search for errors.

### 3.2 Alerts Configuration

- List any CloudWatch alarms or other alerting mechanisms set up for `<AGENT_NAME>`.
- Specify threshold conditions (e.g., if error count > `<THRESHOLD>` or if the Lambda fails to run).
- Include notification channels (e.g., SNS topics, email, Slack) for these alerts.

### 3.3 Dashboard (if any)

- Mention if there is a CloudWatch dashboard or other monitoring dashboard tracking `<AGENT_NAME>`’s metrics.
- List which metrics/graphs to check and what anomalies to look for.

---

## 4. Standard Operating Procedures

### 4.1 Start/Stop/Restart (if applicable)

- Explain how to manually start, stop, or restart `<AGENT_NAME>` if that concept applies (for a Lambda, this might not be applicable beyond enabling/disabling triggers).
- *(If not applicable, note as such.)*

### 4.2 Routine Maintenance Tasks

- Outline any periodic tasks or maintenance required (e.g., rotating secrets, updating dependency libraries, cleaning up logs, etc.).

### 4.3 Performance Tuning

- If relevant, note how to adjust resources (memory/CPU allocation for Lambda) or other settings to tune performance of `<AGENT_NAME>`.
- Describe the process for evaluating and applying these changes.

---

## 5. Incident Response & Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Common Issues and Symptoms

- List common problems (e.g., `<AGENT_NAME>` fails to process events, outputs errors) and how these issues manifest (error messages, alerts triggered).
- Example:  
  - Symptom: `<AGENT_NAME>_ErrorRateAlarm` triggered  
  - Symptom: No output files generated for expected input events

### 5.2 Diagnostic Steps

- For each common issue, provide steps to investigate.
- Example diagnostics:
  - Check CloudWatch Logs for specific error patterns.
  - Verify upstream events (ensure `<PREVIOUS_AGENT>` delivered an event to `<AGENT_NAME>`).
  - Check AWS console for Lambda throttling errors or configuration changes.
  - Test manual invocation with a known-good test event.

### 5.3 Resolution Steps

- Guide how to mitigate or resolve issues.
- Examples:
  - If the agent is stuck due to a bad message, describe how to clear the queue or dead-letter it.
  - If an API key is expired, describe how to update it in Secrets Manager or environment variables.
  - If a code bug is suspected, how to roll back to a previous version or deploy a hotfix.

### 5.4 Escalation

- Provide instructions on when and how to escalate issues that cannot be resolved immediately.
- Include contact information or team channel for the VirtualAgentics AI Engineering team.
- Specify documentation requirements (e.g., update incident log, notify stakeholders).

---

## 6. Recovery and Disaster Recovery

- Provide instructions for larger recovery scenarios:
  - How to recover `<AGENT_NAME>` after a major incident or outage (e.g., region failure, data corruption).
  - Describe how to redeploy `<AGENT_NAME>` in a backup region (if part of DR strategy), or how to restore data from backups if `<AGENT_NAME>` relies on any state.
- Reference the broader Backup and DR strategy document if applicable, but focus on `<AGENT_NAME>`-specific actions.
- *(Include any scheduled DR test procedures and frequency.)*

---

## 7. Appendices

- Reference diagrams, additional context, or links to related documents (for example, the agent’s design spec or `Monitoring_and_Alerting.md` for cross-reference).
- Contact list or on-call schedule link if appropriate.
- *(Include links to AWS resource dashboards, wiki pages, or internal runbooks.)*

---

*Note: Replace all placeholders such as `<AGENT_NAME>`, `<THRESHOLD>`, `<PREVIOUS_AGENT>`, etc. Fill in the exact details for your agent, and keep this runbook up to date with every code or process change. Regularly review and test all procedures, especially those related to recovery and escalation.*
